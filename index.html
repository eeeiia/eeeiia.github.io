          </h1>
          <p>
            I'm an actor with a background in visual art.
            <br>
            <br>
            I was born in NY and grew up in San Francisco's Sunset District. 
            I come from a very practical and loving Chinese family, both my parents have dedicated 
            their lives to the fields of medicine and science. It was thus instilled in me at a
            young age to care to help and serve others as well as our humanity. 
            <br>
            <br>
            From as early as I can remember, I have loved art and expression. 
            This driving force of mine was less understood by my family, and amplified 
            a desire to be accepted. I became ashamed of what I loved but continued 
            to create art using an abstract visual language to hold my emotions, 
            stories, and inner life. Abstraction would comfortably keep me in 
            a place of obscurity.
            <br>
            <br>
            Through the years, I developed a heightened sense to the body and environment. I 
            attuned myself to the weather and other natural phenomena, finding meaning and 
            messages in the present moment. My art practice had evolved into listening, and 
            I wanted to get closer to this practice of listening while also desiring
            to express myself more freely, to speak more openly. 
            <br>
            <br>
            When I shifted into acting, I found a way to listen and respond, but also connect. 
            And finally I felt my family's acceptance when I told them this is what I'm doing now. 
            I think it's because I've finally learned to share my truth, and perhaps when we share
            truthfully, others also cannot ignore it.
